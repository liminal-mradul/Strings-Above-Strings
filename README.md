# Strings Above Strings

*"The most effective form of control is the one you don’t even realize exists."*

**Strings Above Strings** is a book that explores the hidden machinery of society — the hierarchies within hierarchies, the unseen power structures, and the events engineered to guide public perception.  

It reveals how modern technology, media, and influential figures act as tools of influence, and how even those at the top of visible hierarchies are controlled by forces above them.
